# CodePaper_JCAP_2020
ABSTRACT:  This code is an example of a statistical analysis that aims to obtain new and tight estimates on Hubble parameter, obtained by considering two data sets from galaxy distribution observations: galaxy cluster gas mass fractions and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements. Here I detail a Python version (the original was written in the Python and Wolfram language) of the code used to obtain the results published in the renowned Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle: A low Hubble constant from galaxy distribution observations. In order to facilitate the understanding of the code, we have inserted some important parts of that article.
